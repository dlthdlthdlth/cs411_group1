Project 1:
Our idea is to combine the fitbit api and eventbrite api to find fitness-related events in a user’s area 
based on the activities they’ve logged on fitbit. For example, if the user is an avid runner and cyclist, 
our app could recommend local races and spin classes based on what’s found on eventbrite. 
A user would log in with Twitter or Facebook via Oauth, and we would store their information in a database.

Project 2:
For this project we would build an api that allows individuals to make educated decisions about
where they choose to live in the city of Boston. Our api would incorporate public data sets 
such as crime rates, income, property values and other criteria by neighborhood and provide users with neighborhood scores 
for all Boston neighborhoods. Users would log in via Facebook or Twitter and their information would be stored in a database.
