Story 2: Set up my profile
Right after a new account has been created, the website asks me to specify my interest in type of sports, 
location, duration, and more. I specify such interests by clicking words that interest me 
(ex. Dancing classes; Monday after 8pm). 
When I click next, website asks me to fill in additional information for my profile, 
such as profile picture, primary location, short bio. When I click finish, I can see my profile with the info Iâ€™ve provided. 

For returning users: I can always click on my profile tab to change my profile information/interests.
