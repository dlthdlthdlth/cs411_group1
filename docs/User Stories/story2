Story 2: Set up my profile
Right after a new account has been created, the website asks me to provide the location where I would like to look for events. When I click next, I can see my profile with the recommendations that have been provided to me by the site. I am also offered the ability to get recommendations from other cities and filter through the events by type and whether they are free or not.

For returning users: I can always click on my profile tab to view my recommendations and change the city to view different events, and filter them as well.
