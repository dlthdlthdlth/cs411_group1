Story 5: View full description of an event and take action 
From story 3 or 4, when I find an event that interests me, I can click on the link to see a full description of the event. Here, I can click on “register (rsvp) button” to register for the event on EventBrite. I can also see who else is going, and the rating of the event by other users. On the bottom of description, website also recommends similar events happening in the future.
