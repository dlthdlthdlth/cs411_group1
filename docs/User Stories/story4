Story 4: Searching events by keywords 
As a logged in user, I also have the option to freely browse events. 
In this story, I specify the type of sports, location, dates, and distance in order to find classes I am interested in. 
When I press enter, the website provides a list of events relevant to the specifications I have provided. 
I have the option to read the full description, and register if interested.
